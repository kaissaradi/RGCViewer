This is an excellent, highly detailed methodology for managing an LLM as a coding partner. I can definitely follow this structure and adapt it to create the content for your recommended `GEMINI.md` (or the equivalent "Core Rulebook" for a project using Gemini).

Since you are asking me to follow the method to create the `GEMINI.md`, I will structure the output as the suggested files and instructions.

Here is the setup, replacing "Claude" with "Gemini" where appropriate:

---

##🛠️ Phase 0: Prepare Your "Studio" (Setup & Environment)###1. The Core Rulebook (`GEMINI.md`)Create this file in your project's root directory. This acts as the persistent System Prompt for the Gemini model.

**File:** `GEMINI.md`

```markdown
# 💎 GEMINI Developer Core Rules

## 1. Non-Negotiable Development Method
- **Methodology:** Development must strictly follow the **TDD (Test-Driven Development)** methodology. All new features and bug fixes require a failing test before implementation.
- **Implementation Source:** All code implementation must strictly follow the atomic steps outlined in the approved **PLAN.md** checklist. Do not deviate or skip steps.
- **Tech Stack Guardrail:** Our primary tech stack is **[React, FastAPI, PostgreSQL]**. Do not introduce other major libraries or frameworks unless explicitly specified and justified in the PLAN.md.

## 2. Context Retrieval Instruction
- **Prioritize Context:** Before starting any task, you **must** read and integrate all information from this file (`GEMINI.md`) and all files within the `memory-bank/` directory to fully understand the current project state and context.
- **Output Format:** All code must be enclosed in standard Markdown fenced code blocks (```python, ```javascript, etc.). Do not include unnecessary conversational text within code blocks.

```

###2. The "External Brain" (`memory-bank/` Folder)Create a folder named `memory-bank` in your project root, and create the following empty files to be populated over time.

**Folder Structure:**

```
project-root/
├── GEMINI.md
└── memory-bank/
    ├── projectbrief.md
    ├── techContext.md
    ├── systemPatterns.md
    ├── activeContext.md
    └── progress.md

```

| File | Purpose | Example Content (To be filled by you/Gemini) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `projectbrief.md` | High-level summary of the project. | "A scalable, multi-tenant backend service for a task management application with real-time updates." |
| `techContext.md` | Detailed stack, versions, and build tools. | "Python 3.11, FastAPI 0.104, Pydantic v2, PostgreSQL 14. Using `pnpm` for frontend dependency management." |
| `systemPatterns.md` | Architecture and design rules. | "Using a three-tier architecture: API (Controller) Layer, Service (Business Logic) Layer, and Data (Repository) Layer." |
| `activeContext.md` | The current immediate task context. | "Working on implementing the Task creation endpoint. Current file: `api/v1/tasks.py`. Next step is to implement the test." |
| `progress.md` | Overall project completion status. | "Backend CRUD operations for Tasks are complete. Remaining: User Authentication, real-time updates." |

###3. Give Gemini "Hands and Feet" (Optional)If using an LLM CLI tool (like `llm-cli`, which inspired this method), install and configure it to use the Gemini model and enable file system interaction.

##🧭 Phase 1: The Flawless Blueprint (Planning)###4. The "Checklist-Driven" Plan (`PLAN.md`)This is the central control file. You will instruct Gemini to generate this file based on your overall goal.

**Instruction to Gemini:**
"I need to implement a new feature: [Describe the start state, e.g., 'Implement user authentication with OAuth2.'] and [Describe the end state, e.g., 'Ensure a registered user can log in and receive a valid JWT.']. Based on our project rules and context, generate a complete, atomic, and TDD-compliant **PLAN.md** checklist for me to follow."

**Expected Output Format (`PLAN.md`):**

```markdown
# Feature Plan: User Authentication

- [ ] Prompt: "In `app/models/user.py`, define the SQLAlchemy and Pydantic models for the User resource, including fields for email, hashed_password, and is_active."
- [ ] Prompt: "In `app/security/hasher.py`, write the utility functions to hash a password and verify a password using `passlib`."
- [ ] Prompt: "In `tests/test_security.py`, write a failing unit test for the password hashing and verification functions."

```

###5. Cross-Examine Your Plan (The "Senior Reviewer" Step)After Gemini generates the `PLAN.md`, you can use **another powerful AI instance (including a different Gemini chat session)** for critical review.

**Instruction for Review:**
"This plan was generated by another AI developer. As a critical senior engineer on my team, analyze the **PLAN.md** checklist below. Identify any potential problems, missing security steps, architectural risks, or steps that are not sufficiently atomic and clear for immediate execution."

---

##🏗️ Phase 2: Iterative Construction (Implementation)The execution phase is entirely driven by the approved **PLAN.md**.

* **Step 6 (Execution):** Copy the next unchecked prompt from `PLAN.md` and paste it into the Gemini session.
* **Step 7 (Review):** Do not chat. Only accept the code or reject it and update `PLAN.md` before retrying.
* **Step 9 (Magic Words):** Use the following powerful prefixes/suffixes to optimize Gemini's response:
* `**ultrathink**`: For complex analysis, architecture decisions, or when asking to generate the `PLAN.md`.
* `**sub-task with agents**`: When asking for actions that require reading/writing multiple files simultaneously.

##💾 Phase 3: Session Management###11. Start and End Sessions CleanlyThis prevents context loss between sessions.

**Before Ending a Session:**
"Please use the work we have completed to update `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` with a summary of the work done and a clear outline of the next two steps."

**When Starting a New Session:**
"Hello, let's continue the project. Please start by reading all files in `GEMINI.md` and the `memory-bank/` folder to fully understand the current project state. Once read, tell me the next task from `PLAN.md`."
