The application follows a Model-View-Controller-like pattern. Data is managed by `DataManager` in the analysis module. The UI is in `gui/` with `MainWindow` as the main entry point. Panels are modular widgets following the pattern in `gui/panels/`. Visualization components are in `gui/widgets/`. Background tasks are handled by `Workers`. Analysis functions are in `analysis/` with core functions in `analysis_core.py`. The application uses PyQt signals/slots for communication between components.
