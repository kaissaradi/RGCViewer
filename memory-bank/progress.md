# Project Progress

## Backend/Analysis Core
- Kilosort data loading: ✅
- Vision data loading (EIs, STAs, Params): ✅
- Data management and caching: ✅
- Core analysis functions (ISI, spatial features): ✅
- 3D surface data preparation for EI plots: ✅

## GUI
- Main window structure and panels: ✅
- Cluster table and tree views: ✅
- Standard plots (ACG, ISI, Firing Rate, Amplitudes): ✅
- Waveform snippets view ("Snippet Cloud"): ✅
- Similarity matrix: ✅
- Raw trace viewer: ✅
- EI Analysis panel now features a switchable view with the original 2D heatmap and a new 3D "mountain plot" visualization: ✅

## Remaining High-Level Tasks
- Complete the remaining advanced EI analysis visualizations (vector fields, movies, etc.).
- Refine the channel selection algorithm for the dominant waveform view.
- Finalize the layout of the Standard Plots panel.
- Add export functionality for analyses and plots.
